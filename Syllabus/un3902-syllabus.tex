\noindent {\LARGE{\textbf{UN3902: Economics of Public Policy Seminar}}} \\
\textsc{Department of Economics, Columbia University} \\
\textsc{Spring 2026}

\subsection*{Instructor:}
\href{http://www.columbia.edu/~mcb2270/}{Michael Carlos Best} \\
Associate Professor of Economics \\
\href{mailto:michael.best@columbia.edu}{\nolinkurl{michael.best@columbia.edu}} \\
Office: 1112 IAB \\
Office Hours: Tuesdays 4--4.45pm \& Thursdays 1:15--2pm

\subsection*{Meeting Times:}
Tuesdays 2:10--4pm, Location TBD

\subsection*{Course Objectives:}
This course has two objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To develop students' skills in research and writing. Specifically, participants will work on:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Formulating a research question;
        \item Placing their research question in the context of the existing literature and/or the relevant policy area;
        \item Using economic and econometric tools to provide answers to their research question;
        \item Writing up their research in a clear and concise manner.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item To provide an introduction to the key issues in the economics of public policy. In Public Economics we study the role of the government in the economy. Broadly, we want to know the answers to four core questions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item When should the government intervene in the economy?
        \item How should the government intervene in the economy?
        \item What are the effects of government intervention in the economy?
        \item Why do governments choose to intervene in the way that they do?
    \end{enumerate}
    We will explore these questions through the lens of a number of key policy areas, including taxation, redistribution and social insurance, and the provision of public goods and services.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Prerequisites:}
The prerequisites are UN3211, UN3213, and UN3412, all with grades of B+ or higher.

\subsection*{Class Materials:}

PDFs of all materials (lecture slides, problem sets, solutions, etc.) will be made available on the course's Courseworks page. I will also send weekly emails with announcements. In addition, the source code for the syllabus and lecture slides will be made available on GitHub at \href{https://github.com/michaelcbest/un3902-economics-of-public-policy-seminar}{\nolinkurl{https://github.com/michaelcbest/un3902-economics-of-public-policy-seminar}}. If you find typos or have questions/comments on the materials, please open an issue on GitHub or email me.

\subsection*{In-class Activities:}
Our meetings will be a combination of lecture and discussion. During the lecture portion, I will use slides and I will write notes on the board. I will post the slides in advance of the lecture. Note that the slides alone do not summarize the lecture. Attendance is required, as is arriving prepared to discuss the assigned readings or the problem sets that are due.

\subsection*{Text and Readings:}
We will read selected chapters from \textit{Public Finance and Public Policy
} by Jonathan Gruber (7th edition, 2022, although earlier editions are fine). This book is available for purchase online and in bookstores. It is also available as an \href{https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/columbia/detail.action?docID=6925765}{e-book through Columbia University Libraries}. In addition, some weeks we will cover academic papers that I will post on courseworks.

\subsection*{Grading:}
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0em}
    \item Class participation/attendance [10\%]
    \item Problem sets [20\%]
    \item Midterm exam [30\%]
    \item Research proposal/paper [40\%]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Academic Integrity:}
You are expected to adhere to Columbia University's Academic Integrity Policy, which can be found at \href{https://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/academicintegrity}{\nolinkurl{https://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/academicintegrity}}. The exam will be closed book. You are not allowed to communicate with others during the exam, nor consult with any books, notes or devices. Students suspected of academic dishonesty will be reported to the University's Center for Student Success and Intervention.

This does not mean that you cannot discuss the course material with your classmates. In fact, I encourage you to do so. However, all work that you submit must be your own. This also does not mean that you cannot use generative AI tools to help you in your work. In fact, I encourage you to do so, particularly for writing code when working with data. However, you remain solely responsible for the work that you submit and so if I ask you questions about your work, you must be able to answer them. This means checking all generative AI outputs carefully to make sure you understand them and that they are correct. 

If you have any questions about what constitutes academic dishonesty, please ask me. 

\subsection*{Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:}
If you are a student with a disability and have a DS-certified `Accommodation Letter' please have the disability office inform me of the accommodations you have agreed with them by email. If you believe that you might have a disability that requires accommodation, you should contact Disability Services at \href{mailto:disability@columbia.edu}{\nolinkurl{disability@columbia.edu}}.
