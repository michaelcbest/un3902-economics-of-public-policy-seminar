# un3902-economics-of-public-policy-seminar

This repository contains the source code for the class' syllabus and lecture slides.

All files are $\LaTeX$ files. If you are unfamiliar with $\LaTeX$, two useful introductions are [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) and [here](https://inomics.com/advice/a-gentle-introduction-to-latex-for-economists-1539391).

If you find errors or have comments on the materials, please let me know! The best way to do this is to create a [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/learning-about-issues/about-issues) and [mention](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/learning-about-issues/about-issues#efficient-communication) me in it. You can make a [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches#about-the-default-branch) of the repository and make any edits you suggest in it and then make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for me to review to incorporate your edits. The pull request can be [linked](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) to your issue so that merging the branch automatically closes the issue.
